Research Experience
======
* **Carnegie Mellon University**, Pittsburgh, USA  
Research Assistant with Prof. Ding Zhao, _July 2018 -- September 2018_        
  **Project 1:** An Optimal LiDAR Configuration Approach for Self-Driving Cars
    * Independently investigated the optimal LiDAR space configuration problem to achieve the maximum utility of the sensor. The whole problem is formulated as an optimization model and a bio-inspired metric is proposed as the cost function
    * Paper has been submitted to 2019 ICRA

  **Project 2:** Autonomous Vehicle Platform Design 
    * Help to design and develop a 6-DOF attitude control system based on a 3-axis gimbal and a 3-axis linear slider

* **Tsinghua University**, Beijing, China  
Research Assistant with Prof. Fei Qiao, _September 2017 -- July 2018_    
   **Project 1:** DS-SLAM: A Semantic Visual SLAM towards Dynamic Environments 
    * Employed semantic segmentation neural network to improve Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) robustness in dynamic environments
    * Paper has been accepted by 2018 International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) with oral presentation
    
  **Project 2:** Dense-WVLAD: A CNN feature based loop closure detection method
    * Used CNN feature to address loop closure detection problem in autonomous robot field
    * Paper has been submitted to 2019 ICRA

  **Project 1:** Robot’s Eyes and Brain: Visual Semantic SLAM System 
    * National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship
    * Led a team to enable the robot finish high-level tasks autonomously (eg. The robot could understand user’s voice instructions and help user to find objects)
    * Won the First Prize in the 2018 International Conference on Optics and Photonics(ICOPEN) 3-D Sensor Application Design Competition (1 out of 20 teams around the world)
    * Won the First Prize in the 28th Feng Ru Cup Competition of Academic and Technological Works (top1%) 

  **Project 2:** VR Multicopter System
    * Invented a muticopter system which could let user control the drone in the first person perspective
    * Won the First Prize in the 2017 International Design and Innovation Competition (1 out of 14 teams around the world)

  **Project 3:** Visual SLAM-based Autonomous Robot
    * Led a team to build a mobile robot platform which could achieve autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance based on RTAB-Map and ROS
    * Won the Second Prize in the 27th Feng Ru Cup Competition of Academic and Technological Works (top15%) 

  **Project 4:** Arduino-based Interactive Facial Expression Robot
    * Independently developed  a servo control-based robot which could make different expressions according to user’s voice command
    * Won the Third Prize in the 26th Feng Ru Cup Competition of Academic and Technological Works (top30%)

* **Da-Jiang Innnovations (DJI)**, Shenzhen, China  
Algorithm Engineer Intern at the RoboMaster Department, _Summer 2017_    
    * Co-designed an automatic AI robot system which is developed for 2018 ICRA DJI RoboMaster AI challenge
