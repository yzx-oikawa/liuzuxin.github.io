Thank you for your visit.

I am Zuxin Liu, a senior undergraduate student at the [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China. Now I am an exchange student at the [Department of Computer Science of Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb20/index.en.jsp), Darmstadt, Germany. My research interests include robotics, computer vision, machine learning, and their applications in autonomous robot.


I was also a research assistant at the [iVip](https://nics.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/ivip/) lab of Tsinghua University from September 2017 to July 2018. Under the supervision of Prof. [Fei Qiao](https://nics.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/qiaofei/), I worked on semantic visual SLAM, and the research paper has been accepted by [IROS 2018](https://www.iros2018.org/).

I spent the summer in 2017 interning as an algorithm engineer at the [Robomaster Department](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) of [DJI](https://www.dji.com/company) company, where I co-designed an automatic AI cooperative robot system which is developed for [2018 ICRA DJI RoboMaster AI challenge](https://icra2018.org/dji-robomaster-ai-challenge/).

In my spare time, I love doing sports and attending outdoor activities. I have won many prizes in sports game, including the running race, basketball match and so on.
