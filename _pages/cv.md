Research Assistant with Prof. Fei Qiao, _September 2017 -- July 2018_    
   **Project 1:** DS-SLAM: A Semantic Visual SLAM towards Dynamic Environments 
    * Employed semantic segmentation neural network to improve Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) robustness in dynamic environments
    * Paper has been accepted by 2018 International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) with oral presentation
    
  **Project 2:** Dense-WVLAD: A CNN feature based loop closure detection method
    * Used CNN feature to address loop closure detection problem in autonomous robot field
    * Paper has been submitted to 2019 ICRA
